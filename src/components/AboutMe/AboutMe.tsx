							Hello, I&apos;m Karan Gohil, a passionate full-stack developer
							with a strong focus on front-end technologies, particularly React.
							In the past, I have transformed creative ideas into functional,
							user-friendly applications. My proficiency extends beyond the
							front end, as I have also dabbled in Python, crafting automation
							solutions and bots to streamline processes in my early years of
							university.
						</p>

						<p>
							One of my defining traits is my ability to learn quickly and adapt
							to new challenges. Another one is teamwork as I understand the
							value of collaboration, communication, and working together to
							achieve a common goal. As I approach my graduation in December
							2023, I&apos;m eager to transition into a full-time role and bring
							my skills to innovative projects.
						</p>

						<p>
							When I&apos;m not working on making beautiful UI components,
							I&apos;m travelling! Exploring different food and cultures around
							the world. Also playing video games.
